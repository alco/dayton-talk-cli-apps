These are the materials I used during my presentation for Dayton Elixir Meetup
on August 5, 2014. The topic was "Taming the Command Line and Erlang Ports"
([link](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/chkmdc6aqnlvc9pmv4octbnc2q4)).

  * `slides.markdown` – a single file with all the slides.

  * `notes.txt` – very rough speaker notes.

  * `cli_showcase/` – an umbrella app that shows examples of using various
    libraries for command-line argument parsing. Navigate into each app's
    directory and see their respective Readme.

  * `squawk/` – the project used for the demo. It has a Readme of its own.
